# CricBase
Documenting my journey building an ETL pipeline for cricsheet ball-by-ball cricket data for use in modelling and analysis.

Equipped with a love of sabermetrics and all things sport, there was only so much data collection I could do in my job before I inevitably wanted to get my hands on some cricket data myself. Finding accessible, high-quality ball-by-ball data proved to be a significantly harder task than I expected. I settled on using data provided by Cricsheet (https://cricsheet.org/), a site inspired by Retro Sheet that provides similar data for Major League Baseball. This repository serves as an organised collection of a small fraction of the work done on this project over the last year.

Tools used:
 - Python (Including packages: pandas, sqlite3, requests,...)
 - SQL
